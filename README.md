# Ants vs. Some-Bees

This module is a simple turn-based tower-defense game played on the command-line, created for the Software Architecture course at the UW iSchool.  The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!  

##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I received help from classmates installing typedocs because I couldn't get it to install functionally. Turns out it just
needed to be installed globally, but I didn't know this. I also used the basic documentation for Vorpal, Chalk, and lodash.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Hard to give an exact number, more than 8, less than 12.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 4, it took a good deal of time, but with the exception of getting typedoc to run, it wasn't especially painful.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Please improve the installation instructions for typedocs! While looking at typedocs --help command, it does acknowledge the idea of a minimal theme, but it doesn't recognize the "minimal theme" on the actually comand line. When you consider the default theme is the "minimal theme", then the inclusion of theme specification only makes things more complecated. Life could have been made alot more simple by just including a heads up about globally installing typedoc and typescript instead of using the npm install typedoc thats on the front page of the typedoc site.
